## Dataset Description

Meteorite Landings

Rows: 45,716

Columns: 10

Source: NASA

Column Names:

  Name: name of the meteorite
  
  Id: identification code of the meteorite
  
  Nametype: lists whether the meteorite is valid
  
  Recclass: class of the meteorite
  
  Mass (G): mass of the meteorite in grams 
  
  Fall: whether the meteorite has fallen or been found
  
  Year: what year the meteorite fell
  
  Reclat: the latitude where the meteorite was found
  
  Reclong: the longitude where the meteorite was found
  
  Geo Location: the exact geolocation where the meteorite was found

“How has the number and mass of recorded meteorite landings changed over time?”

Why it’s important:
Understanding how meteorite landings and their masses have changed over time helps reveal both scientific and observational trends. It can show whether meteorite activity has fluctuated across different decades or whether improvements in detection technology and record-keeping have influenced the number of documented landings. This question provides valuable historical context about how human observation and meteorite patterns intersect, helping researchers understand whether we’re truly seeing changes in meteorite activity or simply changes in how we record them.

Why it’s important:
Understanding how meteorite landings and their masses have changed over time helps reveal both scientific and observational trends. It can show whether meteorite activity has fluctuated across different decades or whether improvements in detection technology, population density, and record-keeping have influenced the number of documented landings. This question provides valuable historical context about how human observation and meteorite activity interact, helping researchers distinguish between natural variation and observational bias.
